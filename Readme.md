# React Google firebase chat application sample

This is a simple chat application using google auth. It uses react,mono-repo, workspaces and snowpack.

Setup yarn workspace first once done then install the client workspace assets by ``` yarn workspace client install ```. In order to run the application run ``` yarn start:client```.

The frontend is very basic my intension was to create a sample application!
